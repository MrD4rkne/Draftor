## Project story
Two years ago, I developed this application using Xamarin.Forms. However in Decemper I began journey of migrating it to MAUI. I didn't plan to do anything else.

The transition to MAUI wasn't merely an upgrade; it became an opportunity for a complete overhaul of the project. I took the initiative to refactor the codebase, apply best practices, and ensure that every aspect of the application followed a clean and efficient design.

The result? What you see before you nowâ€”a polished, simple application built on MAUI, design to my needs.

Welcome to the new and improved version of the app, where every line of code reflects dedication to excellence and a commitment to practising clean code.
